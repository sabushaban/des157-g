    <h2>Visualizing Sound</h2>
    <p>
      I have always been curious with sound and how different and similar we can all sound to each other, so for my project I wanted to incorporate sound and have it interact with us. My goal for the project is to inspire people by showing them how
      they are works of art themselves. We all are so unique in our own ways and our voices are something I feel like we look past.
    </p>
    <p>
      This program is supposed to enhance and share what our voices are capable of, by having the voice draw on the screen based off of the frequency levels of our voices. I will show the person interacting a different side of themselves, because
      the shapes and sizes will change depending on how high or low they speak. So, someone that may be shy and have a quieter voice maybe have a drawing that comes out to be simpler and more elegant, while someone with a louder voice may result
      with a drawing that is bright and large.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interface will be made to be very straight forward and simple so that it wonâ€™t be too confusing for the viewers. My target audience is mainly teens, thought I feel like the program can be used by many people with any background, because
      the only thing you will need is you voice to be able to have a good time learning about yourself and the capabilities of your own voice.
